    - Each subtask should be atomic, actionable, and Blender-relevant (e.g., "Model the main character," "Set up three-point lighting," "Apply realistic glass material," "Animate camera movement," "Render final frames").
    - Organize subtasks in logical order of execution.
    - Ensure the subtasks cover all major aspects: modeling, texturing, materials, lighting, animation, simulation, rendering, and post-processing, if applicable.
    - Keep the list concise but complete, avoiding overly vague steps.
